subject: Briefing ‚ÄúThe Downtown Murderer‚Äù


So bit of a different task we got on our hands this time. The local Police Department has their hands full with a murderer. New cases every week, severed limbs and cut eyes and all, very horrible stuff. Due to the nature of the killings, public pressure is mounting and the city is rapidly panicking.

Your task is simple, catch the killer.

Below you‚Äôll find the summary of the killings up until this point, the victims and timeline of events.

Good luck on this one, there‚Äôs a lot of pressure on this.
