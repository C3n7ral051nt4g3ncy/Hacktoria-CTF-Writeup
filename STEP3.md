# STEP 3

**Instructions:** Excellent work on finding the locations, the state of the victims matches the killers MO exactly. In a twist of fate, or by the hands of the killer, we’ve received an anonymous tip regarding a video that surfaced. It’s on a completely new YouTube channel, no other content posted, we believe the account to be a sock puppet.

We need you to find out the meaning of the video on this channel. Does this get us anywhere?

# Methodology

Went to the video and analyzed the YouTube account of the killer, searched in the "About" section, looked for the flag in the video tags, comments, subtitles/audio transcription.<br>

I then used Youtube-dl to download the file directly. **Youtube-dl is fast and efficient!**

No information was found in the file metadata, so I decided to isolate the audio from the video.

```
$ youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format "mp3" https://youtu.be/yTHhV_tEOYY
```
Opened the Audio File with Audacity, chose "multiview". Flag was found. <br>
