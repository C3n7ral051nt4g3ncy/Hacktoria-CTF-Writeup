# STEP 2

**Instructions:** *Alright not sure how you are  getting on with figuring out why these people are targeted, but we believe the killer just left us another clue. We received the following  message with 3 attached images:*<br>
**The Killer said:** “You missed a few, they deserve to rest properly”*<br>
Below are the images of the three locations, identify where these are so the local police units can look for bodies. We need the names of the locations.

**Location 1**

# Methodology

I used Google Lens for Location 1 and Location 2, I am a big fan of Google Lens, but one overlooked very powerful image reverse search tool is Yandex. Yandex found Location 3 by isolating the logo.
