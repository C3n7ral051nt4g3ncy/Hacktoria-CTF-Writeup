# STEP 5

**Instructions:** Alright so big hit today! There was a note found at the local university, people got suspicious at the request stated on this note and contacted the local police. The person stated on the note is not familiar at the university, the needed email address had also been cut off.

We sent the original note for forensic analysis to the lab, this will however take several days. Attached below you will find a typed out copy of the note as found in the university.

<ins>Objective</ins>: **Trick this person into scheduling a meeting with an undercover agent.** <br>

# Methodology

This was one of my favorite parts of the CTF, it's offensive intelligence collection with real interraction with the target, kudos to Hacktoria, this was very well thought out. My first action was to concentrate all efforts on the name, if a name was put on the note, it means it must have some relevance to the CTF, I had a hunch that the target would have a social account somewhere, searched Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Tik Tok, Twitch, SnapChat, VK, Reddit. The target is called Marlene Esther-Obdam, but who actually puts their full name on social networks?. I found the killer's Twitter account by a simple search: Marlene Obd... (even without adding the a and m, Twitter pulled up a profile)

```
The killer's Twitter Account below:

<br>

The Twitter account profile photo is an eye, and there is a UFO, a link to Hacktoria, and an email address. This information confirms that I found what is needed.
An email was sent to the Gmail address of the killer, I stated that I would like to participate in the study as I have an eye condition.
The killer returned an email, see below:<br>
