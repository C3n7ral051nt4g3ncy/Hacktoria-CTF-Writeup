# STEP 4

**Instructions:** Amazing job on finding the meaning of that message. Local Police Department was chasing down a rabbit hole deep enough to come out in China, excellent work. So we just got word of a new missing person, her name is Julia Morena, 35 years old from 210-200 W 4th St, Hinsdale, IL 60521, USA.

Julia never arrived for her evening shift at the hospital two days ago, her co-workers couldnâ€™t reach her so they contacted her family. After getting nowhere, they contacted us. Please locate Julia and find out if her disappearance is related to the killings. We will need her location, dead or alive unfortunately. I suggest you keep an eye out in case the killer posts something about this.

# Methodology

The hint in the text above tells us we need to go back to the blog address found in [STEP 3 ](https://github.com/C3n7ral051nt4g3ncy/Hacktoria-CTF-Writeup/blob/master/STEP3.md), going back to the blog, one particular post draws my attention: https://theyarehereamongus.blogspot.com/2022/05/i-think-i-have-something.html, some letters have been modified. These letters give us the following 3 words: **fills ballots necks.**

As we need to find a location for Julia Morena, I decided to try putting these words into the website: https://what3words.com/fills.ballots.necks

This gives us the location Laramie Park, IL, which fits with the killer's preferred location.
